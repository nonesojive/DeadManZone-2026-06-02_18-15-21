## 1. Executive summary

**DeadManZone** is a grimdark retro-futurist WW1 trench autobattler. Players act as **quartermaster and general**: arrange shaped pieces on a zoned grid, shop between fights, then watch deterministic combat auto-resolve with **two command pauses** per fight. No unit micro.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Genre | Roguelite autobattler / spatial loadout builder |
| Session | 10-fight linear gauntlet, ~30–40 minutes |
| Build phase | 2D UI grid puzzle (*Backpack Battles*, *The Bazaar*) |
| Combat phase | 3D Synty arena spectacle (*Top Troops* tempo) |
| Sim | Pure C# tick combat, event-log replay, PvP-ready |
| Demo factions | 3 playable, 3 enemy pools |
| Long-term | 12 factions, async PvP, campaign chapters |

**Core tension:** Every run forces a trade between **economy/shop power** (rear buildings, shop modifiers) and **combat capability** (front-line units, synergies).

### v3.0 headline changes (from v2.0)

| Area | v2.0 doc | **Shipped (v3.0)** |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Combat pacing | Fixed 4 segments (Opening / Main / Brief / Gas) | **Continuous fight** + **HP-triggered pauses** at 75% / 30% army HP |
| Battlefield width | 25 columns (7 neutral) | **23 columns (5 neutral)** |
| Shop UX | 3 lanes × 3 offers, per-lane reroll | **Unified 8–12 slot grid**, single reroll (lanes remain in data) |
| Synergies | Supply neighbor +1 damage | **Removed**; **Inspiring** +5% move charge added |
| Echo synergy | Echo + Stealth tag | Echo + neighbor with **Stealth ability** |
| Critical mass | 3 rules | **4 rules** (+ Assault ≥3 → +10% move charge) |
| Build HUD | Resources only | **Army strength / matchup preview** |
| Content count | “25 pieces” | **38 generated**, **25 Synty art-pass roster**, **46 piece assets** |
| UI cards | Procedural runtime cards | **Manually authored** `UnitDetailCard` + `ShopOfferCard` prefabs |

## 2. Vision & pillars

### Fantasy

A planet locked in endless trench war — warlords rise and fall, but the grind never ends. Brass machinery, diesel engines, gas masks, coil-rifles, and field-expedient armor under perpetual artillery haze.

### Reference matrix

| Layer | Influences | What we take |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Build / shop | *Backpack Battles*, *The Bazaar* | Spatial grid, adjacency synergies, offer grid, freeze/reroll |
| Combat feel | *Total War*, TFT clarity | General-not-sergeant commands, readable army HP stakes |
| Presentation | *Top Troops* | 3D angled arena, auto-battle spectacle |
| Long-term | Async autobattlers | Deterministic sim from day one |

### Design pillars

1. **Spatial loadout** — Shaped pieces, zone restrictions, rotation, adjacency synergies, tag combos.
2. **Economy vs war** — Four resources; rear buildings compete with front-line combat power.
3. **Casualties without per-unit HP bookkeeping** — Manpower upkeep and salvage abstract losses between fights.
4. **Run tension via Morale** — Rare heals; losses hurt more as gauntlet progress increases.
5. **Horizontal war** — Build layout is fight layout; war pushes **left (player) → right (enemy)**.
6. **General, not sergeant** — Positioning matters in sim; player sets **tactics** and **queued abilities** at pauses only.
7. **Data-first content** — New pieces, factions, enemies, and synergies ship via ScriptableObjects without code changes.

---

## 3. Player fantasy & core loop

### Run flow

```
Main Menu
  → Faction select (IronMarch Union unlocked; others on first victory)
  → Opening shop + board placement (HQ auto-spawned)
  → Fight loop ×10
       Build phase   — shop, place/move in board or Reserves, manpower gate
       Combat        — 3D arena replay, continuous sim, 2 HP-triggered pauses
       Aftermath     — battle report, rewards, morale check
  → Victory (fight 10 cleared) / Defeat (Morale ≤ 0)
```

### Build phase

- **Unified shop grid** (8 baseline slots, up to 12 with board unlocks).
- Drag pieces between **main board**, **Reserves** (2×9 spatial grid), and sell zone.
- **Q/R rotation** while dragging.
- **Manpower gate** blocks fight start if deployed upkeep exceeds available Manpower.
- **Army strength preview** compares player board vs next enemy template.
- Board persists across gauntlet; HQ immovable for entire run.

### Combat phase

- Deterministic tick sim → event log → Unity replay in additive 3D combat arena.
- **Two command pauses** when either army’s total combatant HP fraction crosses **75%**, then **30%** (first crossing per threshold, either side).
- **Anti-stall gas** begins at global tick **300** (~30 s); ramps until win or max fight length.

### Aftermath

- Battle report: outcome, supplies earned (post-combat income), morale delta, manpower casualties, top damage dealt/taken.
- Authority resets to board pool next build round (`AuthorityIncome` max).
- Shop refreshes; salvage chance = faction base + combat-board boost (unchanged by fight outcome).

---

## 4. Economy — four resources

| Resource | Role | Earned from | Spent on |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Supplies** | Shop currency (UI label; code may use `goldCost`) | **Post-combat income** (fight-index base + board bonuses); sell refunds (~50%) | Purchases, rerolls, relief items |
| **Manpower** | Deploy gate — upkeep per `combatant` on board | **Post-combat muster** (faction base + buildings/synergies on aggregate board) | Implicit deploy cost |
| **Authority** | Command currency; **resets each build round** to board pool max | HQ + command buildings (`AuthorityIncome` in HUD) | Tactics, pause abilities (combat UI may show as Requisition) |
| **Morale** | Run health (**0 = run over**) | Rare pieces/effects | Loss severity × fight index; some buys |

### Manpower gate

- **Hard block:** Cannot begin fight if board upkeep > available Manpower.
- **Once per run:** Emergency Draft covers shortfall (Inspector wiring may be required in Run scene).
- **Relief:** Shop one-shots and buildings may spend Supplies and/or Morale.

### Salvage (sell piece)

| Refund | Ratio |
|--------|-------|
| Supplies | 50% |
| Authority | 50% |
| Manpower | 25% |

**Dust Scourge bonus:** +25% supplies from **sell refunds** (not salvage shop chance).

### Post-combat income (v3.2)

After **every** fight (win, loss, or draw):

| Resource | Gain |
|----------|------|
| **Supplies** | Faction `baseSuppliesPerRound` + building flat bonuses (e.g. Supply Depot +5) + critical-mass supplies bonuses from aggregate HQ+combat board |
| **Manpower** | Muster income: faction `baseMusterPerShop` + piece/building `musterPerShop` + supply adjacency synergy |

Top bar **income labels** (`SuppliesIncome`, `ManpowerIncome`) preview these values during build. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-build-hud-economy-design.md`.

**Removed (2026-07-01 content pass):** `FightRewardTable` — no per-fight-index supply ladder; win/loss/draw do not change supplies or manpower grants.

### IronMarch Union economy (current vertical slice)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Run start supplies | 50 |
| Run start manpower | 15 |
| Supplies per fight (empty board) | +10 (`baseSuppliesPerRound`) |
| Manpower per shop (empty board) | +1 (`baseMusterPerShop`) |
| Salvage chance base | 1% |

Board pieces add on top (Supply Depot +5 supplies/round, Recruitment Office +1 manpower/round, Officer Quarters authority scaling, etc.).

### Salvage shop chance (v3.1)

Per-offer-slot chance that a shop piece comes from the **last enemy faction** pool:

```
min(50%, faction.baseSalvageChancePercent + combatBoardSalvageBoost)
```

Board boost from pieces on the **combat board** (`SalvageChanceBonus`, +5% flag). **Not** modified by win/loss, destroyed enemies, or victory bonus. HUD field: `SalvageNumber`.

**Tutorial softness:** Enemy template progression only (fights 1–3 use lighter compositions). No hidden combat nerfs and no per-fight supply ladder.

---

## 5. Board, zones & reserves

### Player build boards (v8)

| Board | Size (IronMarch) | Contents |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Combat board** | 6×6 | Infantry, vehicles, combat structures |
| **HQ board** | 6×3 (faction-specific, may use blocked cells) | Buildings and economy |

Shared **Reserves** (2×9) hold unplaced pieces for both boards. Combat projection uses player 6 + neutral 5 + enemy 6 columns.

Legacy Rear/Support/Front zones are removed from the combat board. "Front" remains a rule concept only (rightmost player column / leftmost enemy column).

### Combined battlefield (23 columns)

```
[ Player 9: Rear(4) | Support(3) | Front(2) ] [ Neutral 5 ] [ Enemy 9: Front(2) | Support(3) | Rear(4) ]
|<------------------- 9 columns ------------------->| x=9..13 |<---------------- 9 columns --------------->|
```

- Units move cell-to-cell during combat from build placement.
- Neutral columns: **2× movement charge** cost; contested positioning matters.
- **Gas damage** ramps in neutral band after global tick 300.

### Reserves

- **2×9** spatial grid (18 cells), no zone restrictions.
- Capacity = free cells, not slot count.
- Rotation persisted in save.

---

## 6. Combat system

### Architecture

```
Build finalized → TickCombatRun.Start(seed, playerBoard, enemyBoard)
  → Continuous tick loop (10 ticks/sec)
       → Pause 1 when army HP ≤ 75% threshold crossed
       → Pause 2 when army HP ≤ 30% threshold crossed
       → Gas ramp from tick 300
       → Win / loss / draw cap at tick 10,000
  → BattleReport
```

- **Deterministic pure C# sim** — no Unity refs in Core.
- Same seed + boards + pause submissions → identical event log (save/resume, future async PvP).

### Pacing constants (`CombatPacingConfig`)

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `TicksPerSecond` | 10 | Sim clock |
| `PauseThresholds` | 0.75, 0.30 | Army **total combatant HP fraction** |
| `GasStartTick` | 300 | ~30 s wall-clock |
| `MaxFightTicks` | 10,000 | Forces draw if no winner |
| `GasRampReferenceTicks` | 200 | Gas escalation curve |

Pauses fire on **either army** crossing a threshold (first time per threshold). Army HP tracked via `ArmyHealthTracker`; UI shows aggregate bars driving pause cues.

### Win / loss / draw

| Outcome | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Win** | Enemy has zero `combatant` pieces **or** enemy HQ destroyed |
| **Loss** | Player combatants eliminated **or** player HQ destroyed |
| **Draw** | Mutual last-combatant death same tick **or** `MaxFightTicks` reached → morale win, reduced supplies |

### Auto-combat rules

- Movement via **charge budget** (tier-based frequency); multi-cell footprints use `ShapePathfinder`.
- Targeting by **active tactic** + **attack range** (Manhattan) + role engagement weights.
- Attacks on cooldown modified by **attack speed** tier.
- **Accuracy** resolves each shot as full hit, graze (33% damage), or clean miss (cooldown still spent).
- Distance falloff in **outer 40%** of max range; inner 60% has no falloff.
- Buildings: `MovementSpeed.None` unless data overrides.
- **Rock-paper-scissors lite** on armor vs attack type.

### Army strength (build phase)

`ArmyStrengthCalculator` produces a single strength score per board snapshot. `MatchupStrengthView` on the build HUD compares player vs next enemy template so players can gauge upcoming fight difficulty before committing Manpower.

### Stat tiers (data enums)

| Field | Tiers | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| AttackSpeed | Slow / Medium / Fast | Cooldown multiplier |
| AttackRange | Melee (1) / Short (3) / Medium (5) / Long (8) | Max Manhattan distance |
| MovementSpeed | None / Low / Medium / High | Move every N ticks |
| ArmorType | None / Light / Medium / Heavy | DR + RPS |
| AttackType | Ballistic / Explosive / Piercing / Shredding / Melee / Gas | Type bonuses + accuracy default |

| Attack type | Bonus | Multiplier |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Ballistic | vs Light armor | ×1.25 |
| Explosive | vs Light/Medium or building/structure | ×1.30 |
| Piercing | vs Heavy armor | ×1.35 |

**Armor baseline:** Light 100%, Medium 85%, Heavy 70%.

---

## 7. Command pauses — tactics & abilities

### Pause triggers

When **either army’s** combatant HP pool crosses **75%** then **30%** of fight-start total. Full **visual freeze** in 3D arena during pause overlay (`CombatArenaFreezeController`).

Player chooses tactic and optional abilities; submissions are deterministic inputs to the sim.

### Tactics

| Tactic | Availability | Authority | Behavior |
|--------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Disciplined Fire | Always (HQ default) | 0 | Focus weakest HP; +1 damage |
| Advance | Always | 0 | Push; +10% move charge |
| Stand Ground | Always | 0 | Hold; −10% move charge; prefer neutral targets |
| Protect Support | Command-tagged piece | 1 / 2 | Prefer rear/support threats; rear armor buff |

**Pause 2 tactic switch surcharge:** +1 Authority when changing tactic.

### Demo abilities

| Ability | Source | Pause 1 / 2 cost | Effect |
|---------|--------|------------------|--------|
| Grenade Lob | Grenade Thrower | 2 / 3 | 30 explosive, 2×2 AoE |
| Shield Allies | Armored Transport | 2 / 2 | Adjacent infantry +1 armor tier |
| Cannon Blast | Mobile Cannon | — / 4 | 50 primary + 25 splash |

---

## 8. Tags, synergies & critical mass

### Tag philosophy

Tags = **identity layer**. Stats/enums = **numbers layer**. One unified tag registry powers authoring, sim, synergies, shop filters, and player cards.

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Primary | exactly 1 | `infantry`, `vehicle`, `building`, `structure` |
| Combat role | exactly 1 | `assault`, `tank`, `artillery`, `support`, `headquarters` |
| System | exactly 1 | `combatant`, `noncombatant`, `hq` |
| Faction | exactly 1 | `neutral`, `ironmarch_union`, `dust_scourge` |
| Synergy | 0–4 | `medic`, `command`, `echo`, `inspiring`, `stealth`, … |

Full 25-keyword encyclopedia UI is **post-demo**; expanded vocabulary exists in data for future mechanics.

### Adjacency synergies (fight start)

| Source | Neighbor filter | Bonus |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Medic | Primary `infantry` | +1 armor step |
| Command | Combat role `artillery` | +2 damage |
| Echo | Neighbor with **Stealth ability** | +1 damage |
| Inspiring | Any neighbor | +5% move charge |

### Critical mass (board-wide)

| Threshold | Bonus |
|-----------|-------|
| ≥3 Primary `infantry` | +2 damage all combatants |
| ≥2 Primary `vehicle` | +1 armor shred step |
| ≥2 Combat role `artillery` | +3 damage all combatants |
| ≥3 Combat role `assault` | +10% move charge all combatants |

### Planned UX (not shipped)

TFT-style synergy connection lines and trait panel (`Assets/Plans/synergy-visualization.md`).

---

## 9. HQ rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Faction-specific | `FactionSO.hqPieceId` |
| Auto-spawn | Fixed anchor on run start |
| Immovable | No move, rotate, or Reserves |
| Not sellable | Cannot remove during run |
| Not in shop | Never offered |
| Combat | Static, destroyable; **instant loss** at 0 HP |
| Default tactic | Disciplined Fire while alive |

---

## 10. Shop system

### Layout (shipped)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Baseline slots | 8 (4×2 grid) |
| Max slots | 12 (4×3 with board unlocks) |
| Slot kinds | Offensive / Defensive / Bonus (from `ShopSlotLayoutResolver`) |
| Reroll | **Single** reroll button (unified mode) |
| Freeze | One offer locked by **slot index** across rerolls |

**Note:** Lane enum (`Offensive` / `Defensive` / `Specialty`) still drives offer weighting and filters; legacy three-column lane UI is hidden in unified mode.

### Actions

- **Buy** — Supplies (+ Authority cost on some pieces).
- **Reroll** — scaling Supplies cost (one button).
- **Freeze** — lock icon per offer card.

### Fight-index weighting

| Fights | Neutral pool | Faction-exclusive |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1–3 | 85% | 15% |
| 4–6 | 55% | 45% |
| 7–10 | 25% | 75% |

### Board-driven modifiers (examples)

| Building | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Supply Depot | −10% prices (cap −25%) |
| Radio Array | Enemy tag preview in shop tooltip |
| Field Workshop | Guaranteed building offer |
| Command Bunker | Bonus offensive-weighted slot (not extra baseline count) |

### Salvaged shop offers

Some offers appear as **Salvaged** (discounted/recycled pool) with distinct card badge.

---

## 11. Factions & content scope

### Playable (demo)

| Faction | ID | Display name | Hook |
|---------|-----|--------------|------|
| IronMarch Union | `ironmarch_union` | IronMarch Union | Command, heavy armor; **only playable faction** in current vertical slice |
| Dust Scourge | `dust_scourge` | Dust Scourge | Gas, salvage bonus (hidden in faction select until content pass) |
| Cartel of Echoes | `cartel_of_echoes` | Cartel of Echoes | Stealth/echo synergies (hidden in faction select until content pass) |

### Enemy pools (demo)

| Faction | ID | Theme |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Neutral Militia | `neutral` | Generic trench forces |
| Crimson Legion | `crimson_legion` | Heavy assault |
| Ash Wraiths | `ash_wraiths` | Gas, stealth ambush |

### Content counts (repo, July 2026 content pass)

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Piece definitions | 17 | IronMarch Union content pass roster (`IronmarchUnionContentFactory`) |
| Enemy templates | 10 | `fight_1` … `fight_10` — new pool only |
| Playable factions | 1 | `ironmarch_union` |
| Tactics (starting) | 3 | Hold the Line, Advance, Disciplined Fire |
| Tactics (locked) | 1 | Protect Support |

### Core neutral roster (shop highlights)

| Piece | Size | Ability |
|-------|------|---------|
| Conscript Rifleman | 1×1 | — |
| Grenade Thrower | 1×2 | Grenade Lob |
| Field Medic | 1×1 | — |
| Armored Transport | 2×3 L | Shield Allies |
| Mobile Cannon | 3×2 | Cannon Blast |

IronMarch roster adds tanks, walkers, mortars, engineers, snipers, and rear buildings (Supply Depot, Radio Array, Field Workshop, nests, artillery, etc.). Faction exclusives include Dust raiders/scrap rigs and Cartel phantoms/signal relays.

### Gauntlet (10 fights)

| Fights | Theme |
|--------|-------|
| 1–3 | Tutorial — conscript lines, teach pauses |
| 4–10 | Escalating mixed faction kits |

---

## 12. Meta progression

### Demo meta (shipped)

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Achievements | 10 entries, local JSON |
| Leaderboard | Top 100 by score, faction filter |
| Faction unlocks | Dust Scourge + Cartel on first victory |
| Storage | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/DeadManZone/deadmanzone_meta.json` |

### Steam

`SteamIntegration` stub present; SDK wiring post-demo.

### Post-demo intent

- Faction mastery tracks
- Cosmetic unlocks (banners, arena skins)
- Async PvP rating

---

## 13. Save & resume

Exit at any point; resume exactly where left off.

**Saved:** fight index, build vs combat phase, board + Reserves, shop offers (seed-locked), all four resources, mid-combat seed/tick/pause state, partial event log, faction, run seed.

**Behavior:** auto-save on key transitions; one active slot (demo); corrupt save → clear error + new run offer.

**Format:** JSON via Newtonsoft; **schema v7**; PvP-aligned structure. **No migration** from pre-2026 layouts.

---

## 14. Presentation & UX

### Scenes

| Scene | Role |
|-------|------|
| `MainMenu.unity` | Continue / New Run / Achievements / Leaderboard |
| `Run.unity` | Build phase (2D Canvas) |
| `CombatArena.unity` | Additive 3D combat sub-scene |
| `Diorama_Trench_PremiumShowcase.unity` | Art reference |

### Build phase (2D UI)

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| HUD | Fight N/10, four resources + **income/salvage previews**, reroll cost, **matchup strength**, build messages in bottom **InfoMessageRegion**, critical mass **drawer tab** |
| Main board | Center 9×10; zone coloring; drag-drop + rotation |
| Reserves | Bottom 2×9 grid |
| Shop | Unified offer grid (8–12 cards) |
| Unit detail | Fixed **UnitCardPanel** + hover routing; `UnitDetailCard.prefab` (units) |
| Building detail | **`BuildingPrefab.prefab`** — fork of unit card for HQ/building-specific layout (authoring in progress) |
| Sell zone | Drag to sell; salvage feedback |
| Pause menu | Resume / Main Menu (auto-save) |

### Unit & shop cards (authored prefabs)

| Prefab | Path | Rules |
|--------|------|-------|
| Unit detail | `Assets/_Project/Presentation/UI/Prefabs/UnitDetailCard.prefab` | **Manual authoring only** — bake menus blocked |
| Building detail | `Assets/_Project/Presentation/UI/Prefabs/BuildingPrefab.prefab` | Fork of unit card; **manual authoring** for building-specific fields |
| Shop offer | `Assets/_Project/Presentation/UI/Prefabs/ShopOfferCard.prefab` | **Manual authoring only** |

`PieceCardView` / `ShopOfferView` bind **text, preview, and state** at runtime. Layout resize and theme colors during **Play** are allowed on instances; changes **revert on Stop** unless the user explicitly **Applies** overrides to the prefab asset. `AuthoredCardPrefabGuard` blocks programmatic prefab overwrites.

### Combat phase (3D arena)

- Synty low-poly units/buildings; oblique camera (`CombatArenaCameraFramer`).
- `CombatArenaPresenter` replays deterministic event log.
- Army HP bars mirror pause thresholds.
- Tactic pause: full visual freeze + overlay panel.
- VFX/audio driven by ScriptableObject sets.

### UI theme tracks

| Kit | Status |
|-----|--------|
| **SyntyTrenchUiTheme** | Active default |
| **GrittyPostApocalyptic** | Imported pack + editor setup |
| **DeadManZoneCustom** | Art-only (StyleBible + components); not wired to `UiThemeSO` yet |

---

## 15. Art & 3D pipeline

### Visual direction

Grimdark retro-futurist WW1 trench — brass, mud, gas-lamp amber. Synty POLYGON readability at top-down/isometric camera.

| Layer | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Combat units | SidekickCharacters + AnimationBaseLocomotion | Role prefabs, scale/tint variance |
| Vehicles | PolygonWar / PolygonMech | Static mesh v1 |
| Buildings | PolygonWar bunkers, nests, crates | Wrappers under `_Project/Art/Synty/` |
| Arena terrain | PolygonMaps woodland apocalypse | Ground + trench props |
| VFX | PolygonParticleFX | Gunshot, dust, explosion |
| UI | InterfaceMilitaryCombatHUD + custom kits | See §14 |
| Board/shop icons | Prefab snapshots → PNG | 256×256; 25-piece coverage gate |

### Synty rendering rules (mandatory)

- URP project-wide; **do not** batch-convert Synty materials to URP/Lit.
- Use native Synty shader graphs.
- Editor menu: **DeadManZone → Synty → Apply Full Synty Art Pass**.

## 17. Data-driven design

### Content authoring model

All gameplay content ships as **ScriptableObjects** validated at import. Code defines **systems**; data defines **instances**.

| Asset type | Defines |
|------------|---------|

## 18. Testing & quality bar

| Layer | Focus | Method |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Core sim | Placement, combat, synergies, gas, HQ, save round-trip | EditMode NUnit (~90+ classes) |
| Determinism | Same inputs → identical event log | Regression on content changes |
| Integration | Shop, board, arena, pause, save | PlayMode (16 suites) |
| Art coverage | 25 sandbox pieces: icon + arena prefab | `SandboxArtCoverageTests` |
| Mechanics sandbox | 7 end-to-end integration criteria | `MechanicsSandboxChecklistTests` |

### Demo ship criteria

- [ ] Full 10-fight run in ~30–40 minutes
- [ ] Four-resource tradeoffs understood without tutorial text wall
- [ ] Both pause windows used meaningfully
- [ ] Mid-combat save → identical outcome
- [ ] Synty-textured arena stable in Play Mode
- [ ] All EditMode + PlayMode tests pass

## 21. Design decisions log

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Sim architecture | Pure C# core + Unity shell | Testable, PvP-ready |
| Build vs combat presentation | 2D UI build + 3D arena combat | Puzzle clarity + spectacle |
| Combat pacing (v3) | HP-triggered pauses + gas at tick 300 | Tension tracks actual fight state, not fixed segments |
| Battlefield width | 23 columns (5 neutral) | Tighter contested middle; tested in sim |
| Shop UX (v3) | Unified 8–12 slot grid | Cleaner layout; lanes remain in data |
| Win condition | No combatants or HQ destroyed | Clear pressure on HQ |
| Manpower | Hard gate + draft + shop relief | Attrition without per-unit HP tracking |
| Morale | Loss severity × fight index | Run arc wears down |
| Card prefabs | Manual authoring + bake guard | Prevents tooling from wiping designer layout |
| Post-combat income (v3.2) | Faction baseline + board bonuses every fight | No `FightRewardTable`; HUD previews match grants |
| Salvage chance (v3.1) | Faction base + combat board only | No win/loss or kill bonuses |
| Runtime card mutation | Allowed in Play on instances | Reverts on Stop; only asset writes are blocked |
| Art stack | Synty POLYGON on URP | Cohesive style, subscription assets |
| Content | ScriptableObject-first | Designers ship pieces without code |
| Faction naming | **IronMarch Union** (`ironmarch_union`) | Single display name; no "Vanguard" |
